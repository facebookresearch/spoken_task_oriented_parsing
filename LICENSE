10. IN NO EVENT WILL META AND ITS CONTRACTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF INFORMATION) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ITS SUBJECT MATTER, EVEN IF Meta HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

This Agreement, and your relationship with Meta under this Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Meta agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Meta shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. Meta may make changes to this Agreement at any time. You should look at the Agreement and check for any changes regularly. Changes will not be retroactive. They will become effective, and will be deemed accepted by you, immediately after the notification is posted. If you do not agree with the modifications to the Agreement, you may terminate your use of STOP Dataset, which will be your sole and exclusive remedy. You agree that your continued use of STOP Dataset constitutes your agreement to the modified terms of this Agreement. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising any right, remedy or power hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy or power provided herein or by law or in equity. You may not assign its rights and obligations hereunder without prior written consent of Meta. Meta may assign its rights and obligations hereunder at any time to any party without your consent. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void, invalid or unenforceable, the same will be reformed to comply with applicable law or stricken if not so conformable, so as not to affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous representations, discussions, negotiations, conditions, and agreements between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof.
